# Loading packages

When working in R, there are some functions and data sets that are always available, but the real strength of R comes from its community of developers who continually improve the set of available features and add additional functionality through an ecosystem of "packages". 

The following packages have already been installed in RStudio Cloud, but you might need to install them when working on your own machine using `install.packages("name_of_package_to_be_installed")`.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(readxl)
library(visdat)
```

# Warm up: variable types

Before we take a dive into the **tidyverse**, let's take a minute to learn a bit variable types in R. The reason that we want to do this is because everything in R is stored as an object which ultimately determines its behaviour. 

```{r}
obj1 = c(TRUE, FALSE)
obj1
class(obj1)

obj2 = 1:5
obj2
class(obj2)

obj3 = rnorm(5)
obj3
class(obj3)

obj4 = c("a", "b")
obj4
class(obj4)

obj5 = c(obj1, obj2)
obj5
class(obj5)

obj6 = list(obj1, obj2)
obj6
class(obj6[[1]])
class(obj6[[2]])

data(diamonds, package = "ggplot2")
diamonds
class(diamonds)
dplyr::glimpse(diamonds)
```

# Reading in data

In this session, we will read in a Excel dataset (`.xls` format). We will use the [**readxl** package](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/) to perform this task. 

Of course, `.xls` is not the only data type that `R` can deal with. Have a look at this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf) to see some data types that the [**readr** package](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) is able to handle. If you want to read in SAS or SPSS files, have a look at the [**haven** package](https://haven.tidyverse.org/).  

## First attempt

The `read_excel()` function from the **readxl** package is perfect to read in a `.xls` file, let's try that!

```{r}
raw_data = readxl::read_excel(path = "data/sample_data.xls")
head(raw_data)
```

Oh, no! We seemed to read in a very ugly dataset. What happened? 

If we open the `sample_data.xls` file in Excel, we see that R didn't do anything wrong! It actually faithfully read in everything that you can see in the Excel sheet. 

This `.xls` file is poorly formatted with the first three rows being notes that are not part of the data table. We should ask the function `read_excel` to skip the first three rows, use the 4th row as the column headings. How can we do that?

## Second attempt

We use the `skip` argument to the `read_excel()` function. Have a look at this!

```{r}
raw_data = readxl::read_excel("data/sample_data.xls", skip = 3)
head(raw_data)
```

# Cleaning column names

The column names of this dataset isn't quite as nice as we would like. 

```{r}
colnames(raw_data)
```

We can tidy them using the `clean_names()` function from the **janitor** package. Even though this package is not officially part of the **tidyverse**, it is a very useful package nonetheless. 

```{r}
colnames(raw_data)
clean_col_data = raw_data %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

We can see the new column names:

```{r}
colnames(clean_col_data)
```

Note that we have also used the **pipe operator**, `%>%`, which passes the results from one function into the next function.  In the above case, these two lines of code would give identical results:

```
raw_data %>% janitor::clean_names()
janitor::clean_names(raw_data)
```

We will use the pipe operator a lot over the next two days, it's a game changer for the way you write R code.

# Selecting data

## Selecting certain columns

We will now use the **dplyr** package to perform some basic data cleaning. The **dplyr** package is one of the most popular packages in the **tidyverse**. Its main functions are designed to interact with the `data.frame` object in R in a very intuitive way. This is why its name is an excellent pun: it is a **ply**e**r** for  **d**ata frames (okay, maybe it depends on your sense of humour).

Let's see **dplyr** in action. If we want to select only the `strain` column of this data, then we can use `dplyr::select()`.

```{r}
sub_data = clean_col_data %>% 
  dplyr::select(strain)
glimpse(sub_data)
```

If we wanted the `strain` variable as a vector (i.e. not inside a dataframe object) we use `dplyr::pull()`.

```{r}
strain_vec = clean_col_data %>% pull(strain)
glimpse(strain_vec)
```

# Selecting columns by character vector

If we want to select multiple columns in the data, we could include more names (unquoted) into the `dplyr::select()` function. 

However, sometimes it is useful to select columns using a character vector, especially considering the "dose" column has a Greek symbol (nano-gram) inside. 

```{r}
# select using unquoted column names
clean_col_data %>% 
  dplyr::select(strain, sample) %>% 
  dplyr::glimpse()

# or the first four columns
clean_col_data %>% 
  dplyr::select(1:4) %>% 
  dplyr::glimpse()

# a range of columns
clean_col_data %>% 
  dplyr::select(strain:rin) %>% 
  dplyr::glimpse()

# columns starting with a particular string
clean_col_data %>% 
  dplyr::select(starts_with("s")) %>% 
  dplyr::glimpse()

# select using character vector
select_columns = colnames(clean_col_data)[1:4]
sub_data = clean_col_data %>% 
  dplyr::select(one_of(select_columns))
glimpse(sub_data)
```

# Renaming columns

We can also rename the columns. 

```{r}
sub_data = sub_data %>% 
  dplyr::rename(time = time_hours,
                dose = dose_Âµg_kg)
glimpse(sub_data)
# a more avvanced method is to use rename_at()
# rename_columns = c("strain", "sample", "time", "dose")
# sub_data = sub_data %>% 
#   dplyr::rename_at(vars(select_columns), ~ rename_columns)
# sub_data 
```

# Mutating columns

The `dplyr::mutate()` function does exactly what you would expect: it changes an entire column. It has the structure that `new column = some changes to the (old column)`. 

```{r}
sub_data %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(time_2 = as.numeric(time))
```

If the new column has the same name as the old column, then this column will be over-written. 

```{r}
mutate_data = sub_data %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(time = as.numeric(time),
                dose = as.numeric(dose))
mutate_data
```

# Missing values 

When we mutated our data, we saw that there was a warning message, `NAs introduced by coercion`. The `NA` is is R's way to represent a missing value. So what happened?

If we have a quick look at the original `xls` file, we see that someone must have copied the data with the heading four times. This is why when we converted `time` into a numeric variable, `R` recognised the column headings in the middle of the data as weird values and assigned those with `NA`. 

We can visualise `NA` in our data using the `vis_miss()` function from the **visdat** package. 

```{r, fig.show = "hide"}
mutate_data %>% 
  visdat::vis_miss()
```

# Filtering out problematic rows

We will now filtering out the three rows of column headings, which we have converted into `NA` in the `time` and `dose` columns. 

We will use the `filter()` function from the **dplyr** package. The function takes in `logical` vectors of the same length as the `nrow(data)` as the input. 

```{r}
## These are the rows we want to filter out
mutate_data %>% 
  dplyr::filter(is.na(time))

## The reverse of the above is written with a `!`. 
filter_data = mutate_data %>% 
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(time))

# could also use: mutate_data %>% drop_na(time)

filter_data
```

# Making summary statistics 

We will finish today's session with something simple, but powerful. 

If we want to create summary statistics of our data.frame, we need to think about which variable are we summarising over. In this case, we will count the number of samples for each of the strains. 

## Counting number of samples

```{r}
filter_data %>% 
  group_by(strain) %>% 
  count()

filter_data %>% 
  group_by(strain) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())
```

## Counting with more variables

```{r}
filter_data %>% 
  group_by(strain, dose) %>% 
  count()

filter_data %>% 
  group_by(strain, dose, time) %>% 
  count()
```

# Saving data

```{r}
write_csv(filter_data, path = "data/clean_sample_data.csv")
```
