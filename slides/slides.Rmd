# Getting started with RStudio Cloud

We will use RStudio Cloud to run this workshop. 

1. Go to https://rstudio.cloud/, create an account and log in. 
2. Click the little arrow next to the "New Project" and select "New Project from Git Repo".
3. Enter "https://github.com/SydneyBioX/tidy2019" (it will download some things)
4. Give your project a name (a better name than Untitled Project).
5. Run this line of code `source("install.R")`  (this may take a few minutes to run, set it running then get involved in the icebreaker activity!)
6. If things seem to be running slowly after installing all the packages, just refresh the webpage.

If you want to run this workshop at home, see [here](https://sydneybiox.github.io/tidy2019#local).

# Ice breaker: find someone who...

The aim of this "human bingo" activity is to meet a number of your peers, learn their names and find out something about them.

Directions: 

- Circulate around the room, collecting names from participants who meet the criterion listed in each box.
- You will have 5 minutes to try and fill in as many squares as you can with different names.
- You can have more than one name in each square and you can have the same name in many different squares.
- The "winner" is the first person who fills in (at least) one name in each box.

# What is tidy data?

1. Each row is an observation unit
1. Each column is a variable 
1. Each cell is one value

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(123)
tidy_data = readr::read_csv("../data/clean_sample_data.csv")
```

```{r}
sample_n(tidy_data, size = 10)
```

---

# Why tidy data?

+ Because it will make our analyses and visualisation easier. 
+ An example of dirty data:

# A simple bioinformatics data

+ We will be working on a real gene expression data from [this article](https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/19/1/51.full): **Systematic evaluation of medium-throughput mRNA abundance platforms** by Prokopec et. al. 

+ The original data was generated to understand reproducibility of three gene expression technologies by comparing gene expression of mice treated with different diet. 

+ There are two pieces of data: 

1. **The sample data** was downloaded from the [journal's website](https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/19/1/51/suppl/DC1).

1. **The gene expression data** was downloaded from the [Gene Expression Omnibus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSE43251&format=file&file=GSE43251%5FNanoString%5Fnon%2Dnormalized%2Etxt%2Egz), accession ID GSE43251.

We will play with the sample data on Monday, combine the two data for visualisation on Tuesday morning and perform basic modelling on Tuesday afternoon.

# Session 1: reading data and basic manipulations

> **Why can't I do everything in Excel?**

+ Processing raw data to meaningful scientific result is often complex and iterative. 

+ It is better and more rigorous to have a R-Markdown file documenting this process (reproducible).

+ In this session, we will learn how to read in the raw data, identify some problems with the data file, remove problemative rows and columns of the data and save a cleaned data file.

# Session 2: visualisation with `ggplot2` 

+ `ggplot2` is rigorous framework for plotting
+ The `gg` in `ggplot2` stands for "grammar of graphics".
+ in order to produce a plot, a strict set of coding structure must be followed. 
+ In particular, **every characteristic of your plot is produced using one variable**. This avoids the "double y-axes" plot:

## A quick example of `ggplot2`

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(dslabs)
data(divorce_margarine, package = "dslabs")

divorce_margarine_scaled = divorce_margarine %>% 
  dplyr::transmute(
    year,
    divorce = scale(divorce_rate_maine),
    margarine = scale(margarine_consumption_per_capita)
  )

readr::write_csv(divorce_margarine_scaled, path = "../data/divorce_margarine_scaled.csv")
```

```{r,include=FALSE}
divorce_margarine_scaled = read_csv("../data/divorce_margarine_scaled.csv")

divorce_margarine_scaled = read_csv("data/divorce_margarine_scaled.csv")
