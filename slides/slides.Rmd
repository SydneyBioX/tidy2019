1. Get gene expression data
1. Get clinical data
1. Understand what the data structure
1. Figure out how to join the two data
1. Reshape the data
1. Visualisation
1. Compute t-test p-values and add them to the plots

# What is tidy data?

1. Each row is an observation unit
1. Each column is a variable 
1. Each cell is one value

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(123)
tidy_data = readr::read_csv("../data/clean_sample_data.csv")
```

```{r}
sample_n(tidy_data, size = 10)
```

---

# Why tidy data?

+ Because it will make our analyses and visualisation easier. 
+ An example of dirty data:

# A simple bioinformatics data

+ We will be working on a real gene expression data from [this article](https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/19/1/51.full): **Systematic evaluation of medium-throughput mRNA abundance platforms** by Prokopec et. al. 

+ The original data was generated to understand reproducibility of three gene expression technologies by comparing gene expression of mice treated with different diet. 

+ There are two pieces of data: 

1. **The sample data** was downloaded from the [journal's website](https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/19/1/51/suppl/DC1).

1. **The gene expression data** was downloaded from the [Gene Expression Omnibus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSE43251&format=file&file=GSE43251%5FNanoString%5Fnon%2Dnormalized%2Etxt%2Egz), accession ID GSE43251.

We will play with the sample data on Monday, combine the two data for visualisation on Tuesday morning and perform basic modelling on Tuesday afternoon. 

---

# Challenges of this data

1. Understanding the data structure and read the two data into `R`.
1. Basic manipulation of the two data. 
1. Merging the two data. 
1. Visualising the data.
1. Reshaping the data for visualisation and modelling purpose.
1. Perform basic modelling on the data and extract insights.

# Session 1: reading data and basic manipulations

+ **Why can't I do this in Excel ?** Because to process raw data to meaningful scientific result is often complex and iterative. It is better and more rigorous to have a R-Markdown file documenting this process.

+ In this session, we will learn how to read in the data, identify some problems with the data file, remove problemative rows and columns of the data and finally produce a cleaned data.

# Extension exercises of Session 1

# Session 2: visualisation with `ggplot2` 

+ `ggplot2` is rigorous framework for plotting
+ The `gg` in `ggplot2` stands for "grammar of graphics".
+ in order to produce a plot, a strict set of coding structure must be followed. 
+ In particular, **every characteristic of your plot is produced using one variable**. This avoids the "double y-axes" plot:

## A quick example of `ggplot2`



```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(dslabs)
data(divorce_margarine, package = "dslabs")

divorce_margarine_scaled = divorce_margarine %>% 
  dplyr::transmute(
    year,
    divorce = scale(divorce_rate_maine),
    margarine = scale(margarine_consumption_per_capita)
  )

readr::write_csv(divorce_margarine_scaled, path = "../data/divorce_margarine_scaled.csv")
```

```{r,include=FALSE}
divorce_margarine_scaled = read_csv("../data/divorce_margarine_scaled.csv")
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
divorce_margarine_scaled
```
]


.pull-right[
+ divorce should be mapped to the x-axis
+ margarine should be mapped to the y-axis
]

## First taste of `ggplot2`

```{r, fig.height=4}
divorce_margarine_scaled %>% 
  ggplot() #<<
```

```{r, fig.height=4}

  labs(title = "Divorce rate and margarine consumption") #<<

## Tidy is goal-dependent: treating each year as independent

```{r, fig.height=4}
divorce_margarine_scaled %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = divorce,
    y = margarine,
    label = year
  )) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text() +
  labs(title = "Divorce rate and margarine consumption")
```

## Can you make this plot using the data above?
.pull-left[

```{r}
divorce_margarine_scaled
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, fig.height=6, echo = FALSE}
long_data = divorce_margarine_scaled %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols = -c("year"),
    names_to = "type",
    values_to = "values")

long_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = values,
             colour = type)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_path() +
  labs(title = "Can you make this plot using the data above")
```
